There appears to be a bug with your show API tool tip, that I just noticed. When the list of possible functions appear while you are typing
your function, and you don't use the arrow keys to change the selection in you list of functions, the list disappears and the cursor is moved
to the next line. However, if you do use the arrow because the function you want
RadASM to complete for you is not the currently selected item, then RadASM works as expected: the function name is completed and the cursor does not move to the next line.</p>
