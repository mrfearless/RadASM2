<p>There have been quite a few questions on the boards about whether RadASM
supports this instruction or that instruction. Especially when it comes to
registers people ask whether Ketil can add support for SSE or SSE2 registers or
the rest of the MMX set of registers. Since this seems to be a common
misunderstanding I will explain it here.</p>
<p>RadASM is an IDE editor that facilitates the editing and building of all
aspects of an assembly language application. It does not do the actual assembly
or linking of the source code therefore it does not really support any
instructions or registers at all. It is your assembler that supports them or
not, RadASM will just syntax highlight them in the editor if you wish.</p>
<p>If your assembler supports a particular instruction and it is not in the list
of instructions that are highlighted it can be added using the <a href="rah_opt_keyword.htm">Keyword</a>
editor.</p>
