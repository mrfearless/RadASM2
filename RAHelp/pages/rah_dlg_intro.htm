<P>
Dialogs are a very practical way to create a user interface for your application. They have the advantage of a visual design as well as ease of programming. Resource based dialogs can either be used as a Window in the traditional sense or as a Dialog with Windows doing most of the message processing. They are an indispensable tool for rapid application development, allowing you to quickly create a user interface without the trouble of measuring every control for use in CreateWindowEx. RadASM offers a powerful and expandable dialog editor that is truly one of the best available. The dialog editor gives you flag-level control of every aspect of dialog creation and editing in a simple easy to use package.<BR>
