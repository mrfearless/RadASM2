<P>
<B>Usage:</B> Just extract everything to the \RadASM\AddIns folder. The source files and other files you don't really need are in two separate folders.<BR>
<BR>
This AddIn is meant as a replacement for the RadASM help function. It allows multiple
help files to be grouped under the help key (F1). RadASM.ini flags can be found at the top of MsdnHelp.asm.<BR>

Supporting files:</font></B><BR>
<BR>
<B>\RadASM\AddIns\SetPaths.exe</B><BR>
Utility to change the help file paths.<BR>
<BR>
<B>\RadASM\AddIns\help.mdb</B><BR>
Database containing the keywords and paths for the various help files. In most cases, it will be easier to use one of the replacement databases listed below.

<P><B><font color="#0000FF" size="4">Optional files:</font></B><BR>
<BR>
<B>MsdnOnline.exe</B><BR>
Set this file as the help file for windows API functions and it will take you to the right MSDN online page when you press F1.It may take a while for it to open a browser window because in the background it is first loading the search results page. Note that this has not been tested as thoroughly as MsdnHelp.<BR>
<BR>
<B>win32.hlp help.mdb</B><BR>
This help.mdb should be used when you use Win32.hlp as your main API reference. Don't forget to set the correct path!<BR>
<BR>
<B>Msdn help.mdb</B><BR>
Use this help.mdb when you use MSDN or the PlatSDK as your main API reference. </P>

<P style="border: 2 solid #008080"><b><font color="#FF0000">NOTE: </font></b><font color="#000000">MsdnHelp
will not function with HTML Help 2 format which is the format for all the newer
PlatSDK and MSDN libraries.</font> </P>

<P style="border: 2 solid #008080"><B><font color="#FF0000">NOTE</font>:</B> This is by far the most useful of all the third party AddIns for RadASM and it should definitely be installed</P>
