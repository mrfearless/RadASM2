<p>The Project Options dialog displays a list of commands that correspond to the
Make Menu items. These command lines are built by RadASM from the variables that
you enter in Project Options or those that are specified as default for the
project type you chose when you created the project.</p>
<p>The link command will be used to demonstrate how to modify these entries.</p>
<p>Link command line from MASM Win32 App release:</p>
<pre>3=5,O,$B\LINK.EXE /FILEALIGN:512 /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS /RELEASE /VERSION:4.0 /LIBPATH:&quot;$L&quot;,3,4</pre>
<p>Let's break down the <a href="rah_assembler_ini.htm#projecttype">masm.ini</a>
entry, the commands in Project Options are identical.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF"><b>3=</b></font> - <CODE><A HREF="JavaScript:popup.TextPopup(text_variable3,font_variable2,9,9,-1,-1)">This</a></CODE> specifies that this command
line is the link command<br>
<font color="#0000FF"><b>5</b></font> - In the project ini (rap) file there is a
section called <a href="rah_proj_files.htm#makefiles">MakeFiles</a>, this number
corresponds to the <CODE><A HREF="JavaScript:popup.TextPopup(text_variable,font_variable,9,9,-1,-1)">file number</a></CODE> for the exe file. RadASM will delete this file
before executing the command and will generate an error if it is not present
once the command has finished.<br>
<font color="#0000FF"><b>,O</b></font> - This specifies that all messages will
be directed to RadASM's <font color="#0000FF"><b>O</b></font>utput window. The
other option &quot;C&quot; will direct output to the <font color="#0000FF"><b>C</b></font>onsole.
Adding a <font color="#0000FF"><b>T</b></font> to this parameter (<font color="#0000FF"><b>,OT</b></font>)
will cause the command line to be output to the RadASM output window.<br>
<font color="#0000FF"><b>,$B</b></font> - This variable corresponds to the BIN
folder specified in the <CODE><A HREF="JavaScript:popup.TextPopup(text_variable2,font_variable2,9,9,-1,-1)">$_</a></CODE> variables
in assembler.ini<br>
<font color="#0000FF"><b>\Link.exe</b></font> - this is the actual name of the
link program to be used<br>
<font color="#0000FF"><b> /FILEALIGN:512 /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS /RELEASE /VERSION:4.0</b></font>
- Command switches<br>
<font color="#0000FF"><b>/LIBPATH:&quot;$L&quot;</b></font> - in this case the
$L will be replaced by the value of $L in the paths section of your assemblers
ini file. The quotes will cause it to be encased in quotes.<br>
<font color="#0000FF"><b>,3</b></font><font color="#0000FF"><b>,4</b></font> -
these numbers correspond to the <CODE><A HREF="JavaScript:popup.TextPopup(text_variable,font_variable,9,9,-1,-1)">file numbers</a></CODE> in the project ini (rap) file and
will be replaced by those file names. In this case project.obj and project.res</p>
<p>After the link command the presence of a comma will signal two things to the
RadASM parser, first that the next number represents a file in the project ini
(rap) file, and second that it should be encased in quotes. The quotes will be preceded
by a space. The quotes will encase everything up to the end of the line or until
it reaches another comma. for example if you had :</p>
<p><b>1,3 /hello /there,4</b></p>
<p>It would be parsed as follows :</p>
<p><b>1 &quot;project.obj /hello /there&quot; &quot;project.res&quot;</b></p>
<p>The preceding rule creates two problems when generating command lines, first
how to include a dynamic filename without the use of quotes and second how to
include a comma in a command line.</p>
<p>As can be seen in the example above if you use the 1 without a comma before
it it will be treated as a literal number however if you wish to use the
represented file in the rap file you can use the $ to indicate that the number
is to be treated as a variable :</p>
<p><b>$1,3 /hello /there,4</b></p>
<p>It would be parsed as follows :</p>
<p><b>project.rc &quot;project.obj /hello /there&quot; &quot;project.res&quot;</b></p>
<p>Notice that file name for 1 (project.rc) is not encased in quotes. If you
need it encased in quotes you can use &quot;$1&quot; and the filename will be
included with quotes. Using this method can allow switches to be used after the
file name has been included. In the first example the switches were encased in
the quotes with the file name and would generate an error, if you replaced the <font color="#008000"><b>,3</b></font>
with <font color="#008000"><b>&quot;$3&quot;</b></font> everything would be
correct.</p>
<p>The other problem presented by the parser rules is the inclusion of a comma.
As has been demonstrated a comma is used by the parser to signal that the text
should be quoted, in order to use a comma in the command line the parser allows
for the pipe | symbol. When the parser encounters a | it will replace it with a
comma. There is no replacement available for the pipe symbol. For example if you
needed the following command line.</p>
<p><b>Something.exe /Switch &quot;project.rc&quot;,3</b></p>
<p>First the inclusion of a comma before the 1 would quote the whole line so the
<font color="#008000"><b>,1</b></font> would be replaced with the alternative <font color="#008000"><b>&quot;$1&quot;</b></font>,
second, the comma after the quoted file name would quote 3 and convert it to a
file name if it was included directly so it is replaced with the pipe symbol.
Without the comma or $ the 3 will be treated as a literal numeric value. So the
command line would look like this :</p>
<p><b>Something.exe /Switch &quot;$1&quot;|3</b></p>
<p style="border: 2 solid #008080"><font color="#FF0000"><b>NOTE</b></font> : In
the case of the compile RC command line the inclusion of a .exe on the name of
the executable will remove any generated quotes from the command line.</p>
