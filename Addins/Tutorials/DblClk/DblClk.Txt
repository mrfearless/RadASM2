Just to test AIM_OUTPUTDBLCLK


Addin Manager compatible.
-------------------------

- The addin must respond to AIM_CLOSE by:
  1. Removing menu items and toolbar buttons it has added.
  2. Freeing resources it has created.
  3. Destroying dialogs.
  4. Undoing subclassing of RadASM windows.

  IMPORTANT: Addin Manager can send AIM_CLOSE to your addin more than once.
			 It is important to keep track of what has alredy been destroyed / undone.

- If your addin has options, then export GetOptions function.
  The function should return a pointer to two or more ADDINOPT structures.
  The last structure must be all NULL's.

ADDINOPT structure.
-------------------

	ADDINOPT struct
		lpStr			dd ?	;Pointer to zero terminated string. It will be a checkbox caption.
		nAnd			dd ?	;AND value
		nOr				dd ?	;OR value. There is a AND and a OR value to support checkbox groups.
	ADDINOPT ends

GetOptions proc.
----------------

GetOptions proc

	mov		eax,offset AddinOpt	;Return a pointer to two or more ADDINOPT structures.
	ret

GetOptions endp

Initialisized ADDINOPT structures.
----------------------------------

.data

	szAddinOption		db 'Enable my addin',0
	AddinOpt			ADDINOPT <offset szAddinOption,1,1>
						ADDINOPT <0,0,0>
