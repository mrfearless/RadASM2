purpose:

tried to make the exact same feature of Delphi,AceHtml,... and many other
IDEs of inserting short code templates

Installation:
copy %assemler%.ct and CodeTemplates.dll to \RADasm\AddIns
use AddinMana to register it

Shortcut to popup is Ctrl+J (same as inf delphi,acehtml)

Syntax of %assembler%.ct is simple 

------------------------ [%assembler%.ct]
{ListBox Item 1}
code to insert 1 ~
{ListBox Item 2}
code ~ to insert 2
{ListBox Item 3}
code to insert 3
{}
------------------------ [/%assembler%.ct]

ListBox Item x - indentifier inside popup box
code to insert - code to insert
~  - is where the caret will be
indentation is copied from current line
{} - empty indetifier ends parsing

for cpp the syntax is:
------------------------ [cpp.ct]
[*ListBox Item 1*]
code to insert 1 @
[*ListBox Item 2*]
code @ to insert 2
[*ListBox Item 3*]
code to insert 3
[**]
------------------------ [/cpp.ct]

@  - is where the caret will be

if there isn't supplied %assembler%.ct for your assemler
rename the masm.ct file to your assembler and then edit it!

History:

	        +scans for Space char too when indenting
	        +quiet exit if .ct file not found instead error msgbox
	         (error printed to output window)
	        +remembers width and height of popup box
