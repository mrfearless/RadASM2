RadHelp 3.1.1 by Ronald Volgers (aka Qweerdy)

To install, just copy the contents of the AddIns directory in RadHelp.zip 
to the RadASM addins directory. Then select Addin Manager from the Option menu
and check the appropriate options for RadHelp. You may need to restart RadASM.
RadHelp is loaded when a "RadHelp options" menu entry is added to the Option
menu. You can use this menu entry to change RadHelp's settings.
