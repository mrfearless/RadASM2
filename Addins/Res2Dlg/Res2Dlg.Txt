Adding resource types
The following is a quick explanation of how to add a resource type to Res2Dlg:

There are a number of icons to choose from but you may want to create you own:

Icons can be added to display for your resource but remember to add them begining
directly after the last icon in the resource file and to add the icon to the list
in the constants section. In all cases ICO_LAST should be equal to the last icon#
in the list. 7000 is added to the incon index to obtain the resource number no holes
are allowed.

Section 1
Add the resource number to the ResEnumFunction procedure in the following format:
lParam contains either the numeric identifier of the resource
or if the value is greater than 65535 it is a pointer to a string id
resources with string identifiers are handled separately later in the procedure

FOR NUMERIC RESOURCE TYPES
.ELSEIF lParam == RT_ANICURSOR <- this is my numeric resource ID
	mov IconIndex,ICO_ANI <- the icon index number to display
	invoke lstrcpy,ADDR ResTypeName,OFFSET szRT_ANICURSOR <- the text to display in res type feild
	mov Supported,TRUE <- this resource type is supported

FOR STRING RESOURCE TYPES (after the list of numeric ones)
IF eax > 65535
	invoke lstrcmpi,lParam,OFFSET szRT_IMAGE <- compare the string type to my resource type
	.IF eax == 0 <- if they are equal it's mine
		mov IconIndex,ICO_IMAGE <- set the icon
		invoke lstrcpy,ADDR ResTypeName,OFFSET szRT_IMAGE <- copy the description
		mov lParam,OFFSET szRT_IMAGE <- mov the offset of the id (local) to lParam
		mov Supported,TRUE <- this is supported
		jmp alldone <- it was found so stop checking
	.endif

Section 2
Add the resource to the preview and save button handlers
In the main dialog procedure (DlgProc) the WM_COMMAND handler
LVItem.lParam contains the resource type or pointer to the name
hLibForRes contains the module handle that the resource is in
LVItem.pszText contains the identifer of the individual resource

.ELSEIF LVItem.lParam == RT_BITMAP
	invoke SaveBmpResource,hLibForRes,LVItem.pszText

Section 3
When saving it is best to use the OpenFileForWrite routine to get a file handle
it will return -1 if no handle could be created for any reason. The interface will
also be consistent.

Section 4
When previewing a resource (except text) you should provide the means to
display the resource as a child of the preview dialog #600 as it is designed to
work with the scroll bars. You can modify the PreviewDialogProc procedure to allow
your resource to display properly
All icons should have the handle in hResIcon
All bitmaps should have the handle in hResBmp
Be sure to destroy anything that you create
