1. Update RadASM.ini (See below)
2. Copy SourceSafe.dll to RadASM\Addins folder.

Updates to RadASM.ini
[SourceSafe]
;Source safe path (where ss.exe and ssexp.exe is found.
Path=C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Common\VSS\win32
;Your Source Safe User name
UserName=rauser
;Your Source Safe Pass word
PassWord=rapass

If you use other than the default database:
-------------------------------------------
You must edit C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Common\VSS\srcsafe.ini

Example db in: E:\VSS60DB\VSSDB

; srcsafe.ini
;
; Three of these variables -- Data_Path, Users_Path, and Users_Txt -- must
; be in srcsafe.ini.  Any other variable here can be overridden in ss.ini.
; Similarly, any ss.ini variable can be placed in srcsafe.ini to set a
; system "default," which individual users can still override in ss.ini.

; The two important paths used by SourceSafe.
Data_Path = e:\vss60db\vssdb\data
Temp_Path = e:\vss60db\vssdb\temp

; This tells admin where to put personal directories for new users.
Users_Path = e:\vss60db\vssdb\users

; From this, find users.txt; from that, in turn, find ss.ini for a user.
Users_Txt = e:\vss60db\vssdb\users.txt
