Usage:
If you have a file opened and want it in a new 
project workspace, you have to create a project 
and copy the files into the new folder. Rename 
the files to the same as the folder name and use 
the new RAP file.

With this addin you can create a new project file 
with the opened file in the existing folder. 
The project workspace is then automatic opened. 
After opening you can add files and dialogs to the 
project as usual.

Clicking on a menuitem in make popupmenu first seaches 
the folder for a *.rap file. If found you vill be asked 
if you want to open the project workspace. If no *.rap 
file is found you will be asked if you want to create 
a project workspace. These actions can be disabled 
with the option = 2 in the radasm.ini file.
