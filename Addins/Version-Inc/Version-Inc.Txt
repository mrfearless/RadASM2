This small addin creates a new menu entry in project menu named Version-Inc.
When the user build a project and the menu is checked,
the version resource numbers are increased.
Version numbers are only increased if the project has a resource file (.rc)

This addin requires RadASM 1.2.1.6 or above.


Options for [AddIns] in RadASM.ini are:

0 for disabled
1 for enabled

The user can HOLD shift when clicking Version-Inc menu for options
OR HOLD control to see about box :)
